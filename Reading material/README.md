## Background Information
In the coming lectures, we introduce the basics of disease modelling in epidemiology. To give you some context, in **lecture 1**, we introduce what epidemiology is, various terminologies and important metrics used in epidemiology. The following articles introduce what epidemic is and what data do people care most about.

1. Epidemic: [Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic)
2. WHO | Epidemics: [Link](https://www.who.int/leishmaniasis/epidemic/epidemics/en/)
3. What Are Epidemics, Pandemics, and Outbreaks?: [Link](https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/what-are-epidemics-pandemics-outbreaks)
4. Timeline of the 2019-20 Wuhan coronavirus outbreak: [Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_2019%E2%80%9320_Wuhan_coronavirus_outbreak)
5. The 2 key questions that will determine if the coronavirus outbreak becomes a pandemic: [Link](https://www.vox.com/2020/1/28/21079946/coronavirus-china-wuhan-deaths-pandemic) 

## Basic Reproduction Number (R0)
Basic reproduction number (R0) indicates how contagious an infectious disease is. In order to determine if the disease will become an epidemic or a pandemic, it is important to know how fast the disease could spread. In **lecture 1**, we introduce R0 and demonstrate how we can estimate R0 using historical data.

## Case Fatality Ratio (CFR)
Case fatality ratio (CFR) is the proportion of deaths within a designated population due to a given medical condition (cases), of such cases over the course of the disease. CFR indicates the severity of diseases. In **lecture 1**, we introduce the CFR and demonstrate how we can estimate CFR using historical data.

2. A deadly disease: measuring case fatality rates: [Link](https://youtu.be/pXY_KM_3kLU)

## Mathematics
In order to describe the spread of a disease scientifically, mathematics is crucial. In **lecture 1**, we introduce the concept of exponential function and first order derivative, which is commonly used in order to describe how a disease grows in a population and how fast a disease grows.

## Spread models
### SIR model
Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered, or SIR model is a commonly used model to simulate the spread of infectious disease. SIR model separates a population into 3 compartments: Susceptible, Infectious and Recovered.  In **lecture 2**, we go through the intuition and mathematical formulation of the SIR model.

2. SIR Example Part 1: [Link](https://youtu.be/yxJUvmngBno)
3. SIR Example Part 2: [Link](https://youtu.be/gYSCJ7u6JwU)

5. Discrete SIR infectious disease model, part 2: [Link](https://youtu.be/0k2cA8nYQiA)

### SI model (optional)
Similar to the SIR model, Susceptible-Infectious, or SI model is another commonly used model to simulate the spread of infectious disease. SI model separates a population into 2 compartments: Susceptible, Infectious. Although this will not be covered in our lectures, it is suggested to read the following materials in order to further understand the concept of compartmental model.

## Advanced materials (Require more Maths!)
The following materials introduce the more complex concept under the hood in the mathematical models. More math knowledge is required such as calculus, linear algebra and statistics. If you are interested in modelling the spread of disease, it is strongly recommended to read the following materials.
