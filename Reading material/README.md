## Basic Reproduction Number (R0)
Basic reproduction number (R0) indicates how contagious an infectious disease is. In order to determine if the disease will become an epidemic or a pandemic, it is important to know how fast the disease could spread. In lecture 1, we introduce R0 and demonstrate how we can estimate R0 using historical data.

2. A deadly disease: measuring case fatality rates: [Link](https://youtu.be/pXY_KM_3kLU)

## Mathematics
In order to describe the spread of a disease scientifically, mathematics is crucial. In lecture 1, we introduce the concept of exponential function and first order derivative, which is commonly used in order to describe how a disease grows in a population and how fast a disease grows.

## Spread models
### SIR model
Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered, or SIR model is a commonly used model to simulate the spread of infectious disease. SIR model separates a population into 3 compartments: Susceptible, Infectious and Recovered.  In lecture 2, we go through the intuition and mathematical formulation of SIR model.

5. Discrete SIR infectious disease model, part 2: [Link](https://youtu.be/0k2cA8nYQiA)

### SI model (optional)
Similar to SIR model, Susceptible-Infectious, or SI model is a another commonly used model to simulate the spread of infectious disease. SI model separates a population into 2 compartments: Susceptible, Infectious. Although this will not be covered in our lectures, it is suggested to read the following materials in order to further understand the concept of compartmental model.

## Advanced materials (Require more Maths!)
The following materials introduce the more complex concept under the hood in the mathematical models. More maths knowledge is required such as calculus, linear algebra and statistcs. If you are interested in modelling the spread of disease, it is strongly recommended to read the following materials.
